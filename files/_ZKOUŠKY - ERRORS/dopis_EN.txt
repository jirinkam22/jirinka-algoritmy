Dear colleagues, 

time of credits and tests has approached. During the semester I found that most students are well-learned theory and can use it. But with practice it gets worse.
The greatest difficulty is debugging of programs, since it is necessary not only to understand what the program is doing, but also to know the syntax.
Therefore, I decided that the final tests will focus just on debugging. I have prepared a number (over 50) examples, in which I took a well-functioning program and I deliberately entered errors. There is a lot of errors, covering both syntax and runtime exceptions, as well as faulty algorithms. Some bugs are really kinky ;-)
Final tests will be done so that the student gets one project with errors and will be tasked to tune it to work correctly.
In order to adequately prepare, I give you all the tasks on the FTP server from where you can download for your training.
I strongly warn that if someone will not work honestly (for example, brings a solution prepared in the computer) I will start disciplinary proceedings against him. Which means that any further attempt to get -if all goes well- first in September.
Regarding the dates, I can accommodate your options. Just a few (preferably more) of the students agree and come to me - I will accommodate you.
Good luck wishes you
J. Kokeš

To download tests:
- Use a suitable program for FTP. Works well TotalCommander, Ftp.exe and more. On the contrary, InternetExplorer CANNOT be used for FTP download!
- Sign in to FTP://147.32.163.62/Student, user = student, password = Heslo_1234
- All tests in a folder "err-tests"
